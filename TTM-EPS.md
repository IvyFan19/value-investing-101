# Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) EPS

## Description
TTM EPS represents a company's earnings per share over the most recent 12-month period. Unlike quarterly or annual EPS that are fixed to calendar periods, TTM EPS rolls forward continuously, providing the most current view of a company's profitability.

TTM EPS is preferred for valuation because it reflects the latest business performance, smooths out seasonal variations, and allows for more accurate comparisons regardless of when you're analyzing the company.

## Formula
$$\text{TTM EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Income (Last 4 Quarters)} - \text{Preferred Dividends}}{\text{Weighted Average Shares Outstanding}}$$

Data Sources:
- [Net Income](net-income.md) (Last 4 Quarters): Sum of net income from the most recent four quarters, found in quarterly financial statements
- Preferred Dividends: Payment obligations to preferred shareholders over the 12-month period
- Weighted Average Shares Outstanding: Average number of shares during the trailing 12-month period

## Example: Meta Platforms (META)

**TTM Ending Q4 2022:**
- TTM Net Income: $23.2B | Shares Outstanding: 2.18B | TTM EPS: $10.63
- Calculation: $23.2B / 2.18B = $10.63
- Reflected impact of metaverse investments and declining ad revenue

**TTM Ending Q3 2024:**
- TTM Net Income: $62.4B | Shares Outstanding: 2.26B | TTM EPS: $27.66
- Calculation: $62.4B / 2.26B = $27.66
- Showed strong recovery with AI investments and cost optimization

**Key Insight:** Using TTM EPS provides real-time insight into Meta's business transformation. Investors who tracked TTM EPS growth throughout 2023-2024 could identify the inflection point in profitability earlier than waiting for annual reports.

## Warren Buffett's TTM EPS Interpretation

**Buffett's Preference for Current Data:**
- Uses most recent 12-month earnings to assess current business performance
- "The performance of the business is what counts" - focuses on actual results, not outdated annual figures
- TTM EPS helps identify trend changes faster than annual reporting cycles

**Key Principles:**
- Compare TTM EPS with TTM EPS from 12 months ago to gauge year-over-year growth
- Use TTM EPS for calculating current P/E ratio to get accurate valuation
- Track quarterly changes in TTM EPS to spot improving or deteriorating trends
- Verify TTM earnings quality by comparing with TTM operating cash flow

**Practical Application:**
- TTM EPS รท Stock Price = Earnings Yield (comparable to bond yields)
- Buffett targets earnings yields of 7-9%+ (equivalent to P/E of 11-14)
- Monitor TTM EPS stability - consistent or growing TTM EPS indicates business resilience

**Warning Signs:**
- Declining TTM EPS over multiple quarters suggests fundamental problems
- Volatile TTM EPS indicates unpredictable business economics
- One-time gains inflating TTM EPS require adjustment for true earning power
