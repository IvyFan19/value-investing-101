# Net Income

## Description
Net Income (also called "the bottom line" or "net profit") is a company's total profit after all expenses, taxes, and costs have been deducted from total revenue. It represents the actual earnings available to shareholders and is the most comprehensive measure of a company's profitability.

Net Income is the foundation for many valuation metrics including EPS, P/E ratio, and ROE. A consistently growing net income typically indicates a healthy, well-managed business with sustainable competitive advantages.

## Formula
$$\text{Net Income} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Expenses} - \text{Taxes} - \text{Interest}$$

Or more comprehensively:
$$\text{Net Income} = \text{Revenue} - \text{COGS} - \text{Operating Expenses} - \text{Interest} - \text{Taxes} - \text{Other Expenses}$$

Data Sources:
- **Total Revenue**: Found at the top of the income statement, represents all sales and service income
- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Direct costs to produce goods/services
- **Operating Expenses**: Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A), R&D, and other operating costs
- **Interest Expense**: Cost of debt financing
- **Taxes**: Income tax expenses
- **Other Expenses**: One-time charges, restructuring costs, etc.

Net Income appears as the last line item on the income statement in quarterly (10-Q) and annual (10-K) financial reports.

## Example: Apple Inc. (AAPL)

**Fiscal Year 2022 (Q4 ending Sept 2022):**
- Total Revenue: $394.3B | Total Expenses & Taxes: $305.5B | Net Income: $88.8B
- Calculation: $394.3B - $305.5B = $88.8B
- Apple maintained a 22.5% net margin despite supply chain challenges and currency headwinds

**Fiscal Year 2024 (Q4 ending Sept 2024):**
- Total Revenue: $391.0B | Total Expenses & Taxes: $306.4B | Net Income: $84.6B
- Calculation: $391.0B - $306.4B = $84.6B
- Net margin held steady at 21.6%, demonstrating resilient profitability despite flat revenue

**Key Insight:** Apple's consistent $85B+ net income demonstrates exceptional profitability and operational efficiency. Even with revenue plateauing, Apple maintains industry-leading margins through pricing power, ecosystem lock-in, and effective cost management—all hallmarks of a wide moat business Buffett favors.

## Warren Buffett's Net Income Interpretation

**Buffett's Focus on Quality of Earnings:**
- "I look for businesses that earn good returns on equity while employing little or no debt"
- Net income quality matters more than absolute size—sustainable earnings beat one-time spikes
- Prefers companies with consistent or growing net income over 10+ year periods

**Key Principles:**
- **Consistency is paramount**: Look for stable, predictable net income growth (8-15% annually)
- **Compare with cash flow**: Net income should align with operating cash flow—large gaps signal accounting manipulation
- **Watch for one-time items**: Adjust net income for unusual gains/losses to assess true earning power
- **Margin analysis**: High and stable net profit margins (15%+) indicate pricing power and competitive moats

**Practical Application:**
- Calculate 10-year average net income to smooth out economic cycles
- Use net income to derive owner earnings: Net Income + Depreciation/Amortization - CapEx - Working Capital needs
- Buffett's rule: Buy when P/E based on normalized net income is below 15, preferably below 12
- Track year-over-year net income growth—accelerating growth may signal business inflection points

**Warning Signs:**
- Declining net income over multiple years suggests eroding competitive position
- Net income growing faster than revenue (without margin improvement) may indicate unsustainable cost cuts
- Large gap between net income and operating cash flow indicates potential accounting issues
- Heavy reliance on non-operating income (investments, asset sales) rather than core business operations
