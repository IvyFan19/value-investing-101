# Net Income

## What Is It?
Net Income is the **total profit** a company made after paying all expenses, taxes, and costs. It's the "bottom line" - what's left over as profit.

**Simple Example:**
- You sold lemonade for $200 (money coming in)
- You spent $80 on lemons, sugar, cups (expenses)
- You spent $20 on advertising (expenses)
- Net Income = $200 - $80 - $20 = $100 profit

**What It Means:**
- **Positive Net Income**: The company is profitable. Good sign.
- **Negative Net Income**: The company is losing money. Red flag (unless it's a startup investing heavily in growth).
- **Growing Net Income**: Profits are increasing year over year. This is what Buffett loves to see.

## How To Calculate It
$$\text{Net Income} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{All Expenses}$$

**What You Need:**
- **Total Revenue**: All the money coming in from sales
- **All Expenses**: Everything the company spent (salaries, rent, materials, taxes, interest on loans, etc.)

**Where to Find This Number:**
1. **SEC Filings** (most reliable source):
   - Go to [SEC EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)
   - Search for the company
   - Look at **10-K** (annual report) or **10-Q** (quarterly report)
   - Find the **Consolidated Statements of Income** (or "Income Statement")
   - Look at the bottom: "Net Income" or "Net Earnings"
   - Sometimes labeled as "Net income attributable to shareholders"

2. **Quick Alternative**: [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com) shows it under "Income Statement"

**Important Note:** Use the net income for the **full year** (from 10-K) for annual calculations. If using quarterly reports (10-Q), you'll need to add up four quarters.

## How Buffett Uses Net Income

**What Buffett Looks For:**
- **Consistent Growth**: Net income should grow steadily over 5-10 years
- **Quality Earnings**: He prefers companies that generate cash, not just accounting profits
- **High Margins**: Net income should be a healthy percentage of revenue

**His Simple Rules:**
1. **Look at the Trend**: Is net income growing year after year? That's what matters most.
2. **Compare to Revenue**: If revenue grows 50% but net income only grows 10%, something's wrong (rising costs).
3. **Use It For Key Metrics**: Net income is used to calculate:
   - [Earnings Per Share (EPS)](EPS.md): Net Income ÷ Number of Shares
   - [Return on Equity (ROE)](ROE.md): Net Income ÷ [Shareholder Equity](Shareholder-Equity.md)
   - [P/E Ratio](PE.md): Stock Price ÷ EPS
4. **Watch for One-Time Items**: Adjust for unusual gains/losses to see true earning power

**Bottom Line:** Buffett wants to see net income that grows consistently year after year. It shows the company has a durable competitive advantage and excellent management.
