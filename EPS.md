# Earnings per Share (EPS)

## Description
Earnings per Share (EPS) represents the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. It's one of the most important metrics for assessing a company's profitability and is a key component in calculating the P/E ratio.

A higher EPS indicates greater profitability; a growing EPS over time suggests improving business performance and potential for shareholder value creation.

## Formula
$$\text{EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Income} - \text{Preferred Dividends}}{\text{Weighted Average Shares Outstanding}}$$

Data Sources:
- Net Income: Found in the income statement of financial reports
- Preferred Dividends: Payment obligations to preferred shareholders, found in financial statements
- Weighted Average Shares Outstanding: Average number of shares during the period, found in financial statements

## Example: Meta Platforms (META)

**Late 2022 (Market Bottom):**
- Net Income: $23.2B | Shares Outstanding: 2.18B | EPS: $10.63
- Calculation: $23.2B / 2.18B = $10.63
- Lower EPS reflected business challenges and market concerns

**Late 2024:**
- Net Income: $62.4B | Shares Outstanding: 2.26B | EPS: $27.66
- Calculation: $62.4B / 2.26B = $27.66
- Higher EPS demonstrates strong operational improvements

**Key Insight:** EPS grew 2.6x from 2022 to 2024, reflecting Meta's significant profit expansion through efficiency improvements and revenue growth. This earnings growth was a major driver of the stock's 5.5x appreciation.

## Warren Buffett's EPS Interpretation

**Buffett's Key Principles:**
- Focus on consistent EPS growth over time, not just absolute numbers
- "The primary test of managerial economic performance is the achievement of a high earnings rate on equity capital employed" [Source](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1979.html)
- Look for companies with predictable and sustainable earnings power
- Prefers businesses with high returns on equity that can reinvest earnings at high rates

**Quality of Earnings:**
- Distinguish between reported EPS and "owner earnings" (true economic value)
- Be cautious of one-time gains or accounting adjustments that inflate EPS
- Evaluate whether earnings are backed by actual cash flow
- Consider capital requirements needed to maintain or grow EPS

**EPS Growth Assessment:**
- Consistent annual EPS growth of 10%+ is attractive for quality businesses
- Compare EPS growth with revenue growth to assess margin improvements
- Analyze EPS trends over 5-10 year periods, not just quarter-to-quarter
