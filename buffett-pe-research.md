# Warren Buffett on P/E Ratio - Research Summary

## Key Findings from Authoritative Sources

### 1. Buffett's View: P/E Ratio is Not Determinative

**Source: CNBC (2018)**
- Article: ["As the Dow tanks, here is Warren Buffett on the biggest puzzle for investors: Intrinsic value of a stock"](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/05/warren-buffett-on-the-biggest-puzzle-for-investors-intrinsic-value.html)

**Key Quote:**
- Buffett noted that a low price-earnings ratio, even if appearing in combination with other metrics, is "far from determinative as to whether an investor is indeed buying something for what it is worth"
- He emphasized that **intrinsic value calculation is more important than simple P/E ratios**

### 2. Buffett on Market Valuation (2019)

**Source: CNBC (2019)**
- Article: ["Warren Buffett is sitting on $128 billion, raising questions about whether the market is overvalued"](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/29/buffett-sitting-on-128-billion-raises-questions-on-market-valuation.html)

**Key Quote from Annual Letter:**
- "Prices are sky-high for businesses possessing decent long-term prospects"
- Context: The forward P/E ratio for the S&P 500 had climbed to elevated levels, especially in tech sector (highest levels of the past 10 years)

### 3. P/E Ratio Performance Study

**Source: CNBC (2019)**
- Article: ["Everyone still relies on a stock's P-E ratio to invest, but a study shows it's bunk"](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/05/31/everyone-still-relies-on-a-stocks-p-e-ratio-to-invest-but-a-study-shows-its-bunk.html)

**Key Findings:**
- Bank of America Merrill Lynch study: Nearly 80% of investors use forward P/E ratio as a factor when investing (No. 1 factor)
- However, low P/E stocks have underperformed the market since 2010
- This aligns with Buffett's skepticism about relying solely on P/E ratios

### 4. Buffett's Focus on Owner Earnings (From Berkshire Letters)

**Source: Berkshire Hathaway Annual Letters**
- [1986 Letter](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1986.html): "we consider the owner earnings figure, not the GAAP figure, to be the relevant item for valuation purposes"
- [2017 Letter](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2017ltr.pdf): "At Berkshire what counts most are increases in our normalized per-share earning power"

**Buffett's Preferred Metrics:**
- Owner earnings (not GAAP earnings)
- Normalized per-share earning power
- Intrinsic value
- Returns on tangible equity

### 5. Historical Buying Patterns (Secondary Sources)

**Source: Picture Perfect Portfolios**
- Buffett historically paid P/E ratios of 11-15 times earnings
- Translates to earnings yields of roughly 7-9%
- Prefers buying at a discount to worst-case scenarios

**Note:** This is from a secondary source and should be verified against primary sources (annual letters or authoritative media interviews)

## Summary

### What Buffett DOES Say:
1. P/E ratio alone is "far from determinative" for valuation
2. Intrinsic value is the key metric
3. Owner earnings matter more than GAAP earnings
4. Price matters in context of business quality and future cash flows

### What Buffett DOESN'T Say:
1. No specific P/E threshold for "buy" or "sell" decisions
2. No simple P/E rules like "buy below 15" or "avoid above 25"
3. P/E is just one clue among many, not a primary decision factor

### Implication for the PE.md Document:
Rather than presenting P/E as a standalone metric with fixed interpretation ranges, it would be more accurate to present:
- P/E as one indicator among many
- Emphasis on business quality and intrinsic value
- Warning that low P/E doesn't automatically mean "buy"
- Context that Buffett focuses more on cash flows and owner earnings

## Proposed "Buffett's Interpretation" Section

**Buffett's Approach to P/E Ratios:**

Buffett doesn't focus on P/E ratio thresholds, but his investment philosophy shows a clear pattern:

1. **P/E Must Be Reasonable Relative to Quality**
   - Won't pay high P/E regardless of growth prospects alone
   - Seeks P/E ratios that are modest relative to the business's quality, competitive advantages (moats), and sustainable earning power
   - Source: [CNBC 2018](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/05/warren-buffett-on-the-biggest-puzzle-for-investors-intrinsic-value.html) - "low price-earnings ratio...is far from determinative"

2. **Context Matters More Than the Number**
   - A low P/E on a declining business is not attractive
   - A moderate P/E on a superior business with strong moats can be excellent value
   - Focus on intrinsic value: future cash flows discounted to present value

3. **Warning on High Valuations**
   - In 2019 annual letter: "Prices are sky-high for businesses possessing decent long-term prospects"
   - Source: [CNBC 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/29/buffett-sitting-on-128-billion-raises-questions-on-market-valuation.html)
   - Indicates reluctance to pay elevated P/E ratios even in strong markets

**Key Takeaway:** Buffett seeks businesses with strong fundamentals at P/E ratios that are reasonableâ€”not necessarily low, but not excessive relative to the business quality and growth prospects.
