# Shareholder Equity

## What Is It?
Shareholder Equity (also called Stockholders' Equity) is the **total value that belongs to the owners** of the company. It's what would be left over for shareholders if the company sold everything and paid off all its debts.

**Simple Example:**
- Your house is worth $500,000 (what you own)
- You owe $300,000 on your mortgage (what you owe)
- Your equity = $500,000 - $300,000 = $200,000
- This $200,000 is what you actually own

**What It Means:**
- **High Equity**: The company owns a lot more than it owes. Strong financial position.
- **Low/Negative Equity**: The company has too much debt relative to what it owns. Risky situation.

## How To Calculate It
$$\text{Shareholder Equity} = \text{Total Assets} - \text{Total Liabilities}$$

**What You Need:**
- **Total Assets**: Everything the company owns (cash, buildings, equipment, inventory, etc.)
- **Total Liabilities**: Everything the company owes (loans, debts, bills to pay)

**Where to Find These Numbers:**
1. **SEC Filings** (most reliable source):
   - Go to [SEC EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)
   - Search for the company
   - Look at **10-K** (annual report) or **10-Q** (quarterly report)
   - Find the **Consolidated Balance Sheet**
   - Look at the bottom: "Total Stockholders' Equity" or "Total Shareholders' Equity"

2. **Quick Alternative**: [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com) shows it under "Balance Sheet"

## How Buffett Uses Shareholder Equity

**What Buffett Looks For:**
- **Growing Equity Over Time**: He wants to see shareholder equity increase year after year
- This shows the company is building value for owners
- **Book Value Per Share**: Shareholder Equity ÷ Number of Shares
- He tracks if book value per share is growing consistently

**His Simple Rules:**
1. **Growth is Key**: Compare shareholder equity from 5 or 10 years ago to today. It should be much higher.
2. **Check the Quality**: Make sure equity is growing from profits (retained earnings), not just from issuing more stock.
3. **Use It For ROE**: Shareholder equity is the denominator in calculating [Return on Equity (ROE)](ROE.md), one of Buffett's favorite metrics.

**Bottom Line:** Buffett wants to see shareholder equity steadily growing over time. It's a sign that management is building long-term value.
