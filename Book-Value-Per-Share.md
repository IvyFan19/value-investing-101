# Book Value Per Share (BVPS)

## What Is It?
Book Value Per Share tells you how much each share would be worth if the company sold everything it owns and paid off all its debts.

**Simple Example:**
- A company owns $100 million in assets (buildings, equipment, cash)
- It owes $40 million in debts
- Net Assets = $100M - $40M = $60 million
- The company has 10 million shares
- BVPS = $60M ÷ 10M = **$6 per share**
- Each share represents $6 of actual "stuff"

**What It Means:**
- **BVPS = $6, Stock Price = $3**: You're buying $6 worth of assets for only $3! Potential bargain.
- **BVPS = $6, Stock Price = $6**: You're paying exactly what the assets are worth.
- **BVPS = $6, Stock Price = $12**: You're paying $12 for $6 of assets. Investors think the company can make great profits.

## How To Calculate It
$$\text{BVPS} = \frac{\text{Total Assets - Total Debts}}{\text{Number of Shares}}$$

**What You Need:**
- **Total Assets**: Everything the company owns (found in [SEC filings](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html) - Balance Sheet)
- **Total Debts**: Everything the company owes (same SEC Balance Sheet)
- **Number of Shares**: How many shares exist (found in SEC filings)

## Real Example: Alphabet Inc. (Google)

**Example: Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)**
- SEC Filing: [Alphabet Q3 2024 10-Q](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204424000103/goog-20240930.htm)
- Located in: Consolidated Balance Sheets

**From Google's Balance Sheet (Q3 2024):**
- Total Assets: $418 billion
- Total Liabilities: $117 billion
- Shareholders' Equity: $418B - $117B = $301 billion
- Shares Outstanding: 12.3 billion
- BVPS: $301B ÷ 12.3B = **$24.47 per share**
- Stock Price: ~$165 (at that time)
- P/B Ratio: $165 ÷ $24.47 = 6.7

**What this means**: Google's stock trades at 6.7 times its book value. The company has strong assets ($418B) but their real value comes from search technology, YouTube, and advertising—intangible assets worth far more than physical equipment.

## When BVPS Is Most Useful

**Great for:**
- Banks (their assets are mostly cash and loans)
- Real estate companies (value is in buildings)
- Manufacturing (lots of equipment and inventory)

**Less useful for:**
- Tech companies (value is in ideas, not physical stuff)
- Service companies (value is in people and reputation)

**Important Notes:**
1. **Rising BVPS is good**: Shows the company is building wealth over time
2. **Compare to stock price**: If stock price < BVPS, might be undervalued
3. **Use with [P/B Ratio](PB.md)**: Stock Price ÷ BVPS = P/B Ratio
