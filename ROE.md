# Return on Equity (ROE)

## What Is It?
ROE shows how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested.

**Simple Example:**
- If shareholders invested $100 in total
- The company earned $15 profit this year
- ROE = $15 ÷ $100 = 15%
- For every dollar shareholders invested, the company earned 15 cents in profit

**What It Means:**
- **High ROE (like 15%+)**: The company is great at turning shareholder money into profits. This is what Buffett loves.
- **Low ROE (like 5-10%)**: The company isn't using shareholder money efficiently. Could be mediocre management or a tough business.

## How To Calculate It
$$\text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Shareholder Equity}} \times 100$$

**What You Need:**
- **Net Income**: The company's total profit for the year (found on income statement)
- **Shareholder Equity**: Total value that belongs to shareholders (found on balance sheet)

**Where to Find These Numbers:**
1. **SEC Filings** (most reliable source):
   - Go to [SEC EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)
   - Search for the company
   - Look at **10-K** (annual report) or **10-Q** (quarterly report)
   - **Net Income**: In the "Consolidated Statements of Income" or "Income Statement"
   - **Shareholder Equity**: In the "Consolidated Balance Sheet" (listed as "Total Stockholders' Equity" or "Total Shareholders' Equity")

2. **Quick Alternative**: [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com) often shows ROE already calculated under "Statistics" or "Key Statistics"

## How Buffett Uses ROE

**Buffett's Sweet Spot:**
- He looks for companies with ROE of **15% or higher**
- Even better: ROE that's been consistently high for 10+ years
- Translation: Management knows how to make money work hard

**His Simple Rules:**
1. **Consistency Matters**: A company with 15% ROE for 10 years straight is better than one that jumps between 5% and 25%
2. **Compare Carefully**:
   - Compare to competitors in the same industry
   - Some industries naturally have higher ROE (software) vs lower (utilities)
3. **Watch for Debt Tricks**: Companies can boost ROE artificially by taking on massive debt. Check the debt levels too.
4. **Look for the Trend**: Is ROE improving, stable, or declining over time?

**Bottom Line:** Buffett loves businesses that consistently earn high returns on shareholder money. It shows excellent management and a strong competitive advantage.
