# Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio

## Description
The P/E ratio measures how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company's earnings. 

A higher P/E suggests investors expect strong future growth; a lower P/E may indicate lower growth expectations or potential undervaluation.

## Formula
$$\text{P/E} = \frac{\text{Market Price per Share}}{\text{TTM EPS}}$$

Data Sources:
- [Market Price per Share](market-price-per-share.md): Current trading price from stock exchanges
- [TTM EPS](TTM-EPS.md): Company's net income over the last 12 months divided by outstanding shares, found in financial statements

## Example: Meta Platforms (META)

**Late 2022 (Market Bottom):**
- Stock Price: $136 | TTM EPS: $10.63 | P/E: 12.8
- Calculation: $136 / $10.63 = 12.8
- Low P/E suggested undervaluation or investor pessimism

**Late 2024:**
- Stock Price: $744 | TTM EPS: $27.66 | P/E: 26.9
- Calculation: $744 / $27.66 = 26.9
- Higher P/E reflects strong growth expectations

**Key Insight:** Stock price rose 5.5x while P/E doubled, showing how the ratio reflects market sentiment. The 2022 low P/E signaled a value opportunity.

## Warren Buffett's P/E Interpretation

**Buffett's Buying Range:**
- Historically pays P/E ratios of 11-15 times earnings (earnings yields of 7-9%) [Source](https://pictureperfectportfolios.com/how-warren-buffett-evaluates-stocks-key-metrics-to-consider/)
- Prefers buying at a discount to worst-case scenarios

**Key Principles:**
- "Common yardsticks such as dividend yield, the ratio of price to earnings or to book value... have nothing to do with valuation except to the extent they provide clues to the amount and timing of cash flows" [Source](https://www.investorsfriend.com/price-to-value-ratio/)
- Compare P/E with competitors, industry average, and company's historical P/E
- Lower P/E may signal undervaluation in quality businesses with strong moats
- [P/E ratios move up based on better business prospects or changes in interest rates](https://www.newtraderu.com/2023/07/18/warren-buffett-explains-the-reasons-for-higher-p-e-ratios/)

**Simple Valuation Rule:**
- P/E Ã— P/BV (Price-to-Book) < 22.5 for value opportunities
