## Description
Price to Earnings (P/E) Ratio is one of the most widely used valuation metrics in investing. It measures how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company's earnings, providing insight into market expectations and valuation levels.

The P/E ratio compares the current market price of a stock to the company's earnings per share (EPS). This ratio helps investors assess whether a stock is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly priced relative to its earnings power.

A higher P/E ratio typically indicates that investors are paying a premium for each dollar of earnings, often reflecting expectations of strong future growth, competitive advantages, or market leadership. Conversely, a lower P/E ratio may suggest that investors expect slower growth, the company faces challenges, or the stock is potentially undervalued.

## Formula
P/E Ratio = Market Price per Share / Earnings per Share

Where:
- Market Price per Share is the current trading price of the stock
- Earnings per Share (EPS) represents the company's net income divided by the number of outstanding shares

## Example
If a company's stock is trading at $60 per share and its earnings per share is $4, the P/E ratio would be:

P/E Ratio = $60 / $4 = 15

This means investors are paying $15 for every $1 of earnings the company generates.

## Interpretation
- **Low P/E (< 15)**: May indicate undervaluation or lower growth expectations
- **Moderate P/E (15-25)**: Generally considered reasonable for established companies
- **High P/E (> 25)**: May reflect high growth expectations or potential overvaluation
- **Negative P/E**: Company is not profitable (negative earnings)

## Considerations
When using P/E ratios for investment decisions, keep in mind:
- **Industry Comparison**: Compare P/E ratios within the same industry, as different sectors have different typical ranges
- **Growth Rate**: High-growth companies often justify higher P/E ratios
- **Economic Cycles**: P/E ratios can fluctuate with economic conditions
- **Earnings Quality**: Consider whether earnings are sustainable and recurring
- **Forward vs. Trailing P/E**: Trailing P/E uses historical earnings, while forward P/E uses projected earnings
- **Market Conditions**: Overall market sentiment affects P/E ratio levels

The P/E ratio is most effective when used alongside other financial metrics and qualitative analysis to form a complete investment picture.
