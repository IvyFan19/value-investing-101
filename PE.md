# Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio

## What Is It?
The P/E ratio shows how many years it takes for the company to earn back your investment.

**Simple Example:**
- If you buy a stock for $30 and the company earns $2 per share each year
- P/E = $30 ÷ $2 = 15
- It would take 15 years for the company to earn back your $30

**What It Means:**
- **High P/E (like 30+)**: You're paying a lot. Investors expect the company to grow fast in the future.
- **Low P/E (like 10-15)**: You're paying less. Either the company is a bargain, or people worry about its future.

## How To Calculate It
$$\text{P/E} = \frac{\text{Stock Price}}{\text{Earnings Per Share (EPS)}}$$

**What You Need:**
- **Stock Price**: What the stock costs right now (check [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com))
- **[Earnings Per Share (EPS)](EPS.md)**: How much profit the company made per share in the last year (found in financial reports)


## How Buffett Uses P/E

**Buffett's Sweet Spot:**
- He typically buys stocks with P/E between **11-15**
- Translation: He waits 11-15 years to earn back his money
- He wants a bargain, not an expensive stock

**His Simple Rules:**
1. **Compare**: Don't just look at one P/E number. Compare it to:
   - Other companies in the same industry
   - The company's past P/E ratios
2. **Low P/E ≠ Always Good**: A low P/E on a great company might be a steal. On a bad company, it's just cheap for a reason.
3. **Quick Check**: P/E × Price-to-Book should be less than 22.5 for a value opportunity

**Bottom Line:** Buffett looks for quality companies selling at low P/E ratios. That's how he finds bargains.
