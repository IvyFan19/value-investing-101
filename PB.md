# Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio

## What Is It?
The P/B ratio shows how much you're paying compared to what the company actually owns.

**Simple Example:**
- A company owns assets (buildings, equipment, cash) worth $100 million
- It owes $40 million in debts
- Book Value = $100M - $40M = $60 million
- If the stock market values the company at $120 million
- P/B = $120M ÷ $60M = 2.0
- You're paying $2 for every $1 of actual stuff the company owns

**What It Means:**
- **P/B below 1**: You're paying less than what the company owns. Could be a bargain (or the assets aren't worth much).
- **P/B around 1**: You're paying exactly what the company owns.
- **P/B above 1**: You're paying more than the company owns. Investors believe it can make good profits with those assets.

## How To Calculate It
$$\text{P/B} = \frac{\text{Stock Price}}{\text{Book Value Per Share}}$$

**What You Need:**
- **Stock Price**: What the stock costs right now (check [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com))
- **Book Value Per Share**: (Total Assets - Total Debts) ÷ Number of Shares (found in financial reports)

## When P/B Works Best

**Good for:**
- Banks and insurance companies (lots of real assets)
- Manufacturing companies (factories, equipment)
- Companies with lots of physical stuff

**Not great for:**
- Tech companies (their value is in ideas and software, not buildings)
- Service businesses (value is in people and brands, not physical assets)

**Important Notes:**
1. **Compare within the same industry**: A tech company's P/B of 10 might be normal, but for a bank it would be crazy high.
2. **Low P/B isn't always good**: Sometimes assets are outdated or worthless.
3. **Buffett's trick**: P/E × P/B should be less than 22.5 for a value opportunity.
