## Description
Price to Book (P/B) Ratio is a valuation metric that compares a company's market price to its book value. It indicates how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of net assets. The book value represents the company's total assets minus its liabilities, essentially showing what shareholders would theoretically receive if the company were liquidated.

A P/B ratio above 1.0 suggests that the market values the company at more than its accounting book value, potentially indicating investor confidence in future growth or intangible assets not reflected on the balance sheet. A P/B ratio below 1.0 may suggest the company is undervalued or facing challenges.

This ratio is particularly useful for evaluating capital-intensive businesses like banks, insurance companies, and manufacturing firms where tangible assets play a significant role.

## Formula
P/B Ratio = Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share

Where:
- Market Price per Share is the current trading price of the stock
- Book Value per Share = (Total Assets - Total Liabilities) / Number of Outstanding Shares

## Example
If a company's stock is trading at $50 per share and its book value per share is $25, the P/B ratio would be:

P/B Ratio = $50 / $25 = 2.0

This means investors are paying $2 for every $1 of book value, suggesting the market believes the company's assets can generate value beyond their accounting value.

## Interpretation
- **P/B < 1.0**: Potentially undervalued; market price is below book value
- **P/B = 1.0**: Trading at book value
- **P/B > 1.0**: Market values the company above its net asset value
- **P/B > 3.0**: May indicate high growth expectations or significant intangible assets

## Considerations
When using P/B ratio for investment decisions, consider:
- Industry norms (technology companies typically have higher P/B ratios than manufacturing)
- Quality of assets (outdated equipment may be overvalued on the balance sheet)
- Intangible assets not reflected in book value (brand value, patents, intellectual property)
- Accounting methods that can affect book value calculations
- Company's return on equity (ROE) - higher ROE often justifies higher P/B ratios
