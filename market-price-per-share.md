## Warren Buffett's Perspective on Market Price

### Market Price vs. Intrinsic Value
> "Price is what you pay, value is what you get." - Warren Buffett

**Key Principles:**
- Market price fluctuates based on emotion and short-term thinking
- Intrinsic value based on long-term cash flows and business fundamentals
- Best opportunities occur when price << intrinsic value

### Market Price Behavior
- **Mr. Market Concept:** Market offers prices daily, sometimes irrational
- **Opportunity Window:** Buy when market price is significantly below intrinsic value
- **Patience Required:** Wait for market to recognize true value

### Historical Buying Patterns
- Focuses on buying when market price is significantly below intrinsic value
- Uses price as entry point, not as value determinant
- Waits for market to offer compelling discounts

## Advanced Concepts

### Price Adjustments to Consider

**Stock Splits**
- 2-for-1 split: Price halves, shares double

- Adjust historical prices for dividend analysis

**Currency Conversion**
- For international stocks, convert to consistent currency
- Consider exchange rate fluctuations

### Volume and Liquidity
- **High Volume:** More reliable price discovery
- **Low Volume:** Price may not reflect true market consensus
- **Liquidity:** Ease of buying/selling at current price
